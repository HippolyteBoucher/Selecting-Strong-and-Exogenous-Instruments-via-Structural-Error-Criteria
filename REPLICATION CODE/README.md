# Note on replication files

The source code containing all the functions used for the simulations and application is in `functions.R`. The files allow to replicate the simulation exercise and the application code and more, but without the format used in the working paper. Given the size of the application data and the simulations results file, they cannot be uploaded and are available upon request.
